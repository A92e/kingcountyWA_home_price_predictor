## Goal & Use Case
To clean, explore, and model this dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the sale price of houses as accurately as possible. This sort of model could be utilized as a predictor for Real Estate Agents, Investors, Technology Companies, Researchers, and other stakeholders to take advantage of opportunities to buy, sell, renovate, or analyze real estate features and their effect on market price.

## The Dataset
King County House Sales dataset. The dataset can be found in the file `"kc_house_data.csv"`, in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in the 'column_names.md' file in this repository.
